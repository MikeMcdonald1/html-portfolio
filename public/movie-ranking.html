<h1>The Best Movies According to Mike</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Goodfellas</h3>
<p>I could watch this every day for the rest of my life.</p>
<h3>Apocalypse Now</h3>
<p>One of the deepest, darkest dives into human nature. Like the main character, you also begin to question your sanity as the movie drifts along.</p>
<h3>Dumb & Dumber</h3>
<p>This movie brings nothing but joy for me every single time!</p>
